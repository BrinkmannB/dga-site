    <h2>How I support public organisations</h2>

    <p>
      AI governance is not primarily a technical challenge.
      It is a question of responsibility, oversight and institutional design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work with ministries, municipalities, regulators and public-sector bodies
      to translate regulatory requirements — including the EU AI Act —
      into workable governance structures and decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <div class="services-grid">

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>AI Act Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Guidance on classification, documentation, risk management
          and compliance obligations under the EU AI Act,
          with a focus on high-risk AI systems.
        </p>
        <p class="service-focus">
          Focus: legal interpretation, governance design and practical implementation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Algorithm Registers & Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          Support in designing, improving and maintaining
          algorithm registers and transparency profiles
          in line with European and national requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="service-focus">
          Focus: explainability, accountability and public trust.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>AI Governance Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
          Development of governance frameworks defining roles,
          responsibilities, escalation paths and oversight mechanisms
          for AI use within public organisations.
        </p>
        <p class="service-focus">
          Focus: decision-making authority and institutional responsibility.

      <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Strategic & Board-Level Advisory</h3>
        <p>
          Advisory support for boards, senior management and policy teams
          on strategic AI governance questions, risk positioning
          and public-value considerations.
        </p>

    <h2>Working approach</h2>

    <p>
      My role is independent and advisory.
      I do not sell software, platforms or technical solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engagements typically start with a focused exploratory conversation,
      followed by targeted advisory work aligned with the organisation’s
      legal responsibilities, institutional context and governance maturity.
