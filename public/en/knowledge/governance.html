  <h1>AI Governance Explained</h1>
  <p>Why governance determines whether AI becomes responsible — or risky.</p>
</section>

<section class="about">
  <div class="about-content">

    <p>
      Many AI projects fail not because of technology, but because governance is missing.  
      Roles are unclear, responsibilities scattered and there is no structured process  
      for escalation, monitoring or risk oversight.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI Governance provides clarity. It brings structure, accountability and  
      transparency to AI decision-making.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is AI Governance?</h2>
    <p>
      AI Governance refers to the organisational structures, roles, processes,  
      documentation and oversight mechanisms that ensure AI systems are used  
      responsibly, safely and in line with legal and ethical expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Governance Roles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Executive Leadership:</strong> strategic direction, risk appetite and accountability</li>
      <li><strong>AI Project Teams:</strong> model development, data pipelines, documentation</li>
      <li><strong>Legal & Compliance:</strong> AI Act, privacy law, human rights</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics & Public Values:</strong> societal impact, fairness, transparency</li>
      <li><strong>Audit & Oversight:</strong> monitoring, checks, incident analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Structure Decision-Making</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear roles and decision rights</li>
      <li>Defined escalation pathways</li>
      <li>Human oversight and intervention procedures</li>
      <li>Continuous documentation and transparency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance & the EU AI Act</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Act requires risk management, documentation, transparency, human oversight  
      and monitoring. Good governance connects these requirements into one coherent  
      and sustainable organisational framework.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Governance Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Without governance, AI becomes opaque, unpredictable and risky.  
      With governance, organisations create transparency, fairness and  
      trust — essential for public value and compliance.
