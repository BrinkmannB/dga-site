    <h1>The EU AI Act and the public sector</h1>

    <p>
      The EU AI Act is European legislation
      regulating the development, deployment
      and oversight of artificial intelligence.
      For governments and regulators,
      the Act places AI explicitly
      within the scope of public accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The regulation introduces a risk-based framework
      and sets binding obligations
      for both providers and users of AI systems.
      Public organisations must be able to explain,
      justify and govern their use of AI.
    </p>

<!-- WHAT CHANGES -->
<section class="section-light section-tight">
  <div class="container" style="max-width: 780px;">

    <h2>What changes under the EU AI Act?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>AI systems must be classified according to risk</li>
      <li>High-risk AI systems are subject to strict obligations</li>
      <li>Transparency and documentation become mandatory</li>
      <li>Senior management becomes accountable for AI use</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The EU AI Act does not prescribe
      which AI systems may or may not be used.
      Instead, it requires public organisations
      to make explicit and defensible governance choices.
    </p>

<!-- GOVERNANCE -->
<section class="section-light section-tight">
  <div class="container" style="max-width: 780px;">

    <h2>Why the EU AI Act is primarily a governance challenge</h2>

    <p>
      While the regulation contains legal and technical provisions,
      it deliberately leaves room for organisational design.
      This means public organisations must decide for themselves:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>who is responsible for AI systems</li>
      <li>how decisions on AI use are taken and documented</li>
      <li>how oversight and accountability are organised</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without clear AI governance,
      compliance risks becoming fragmented
      and reactive rather than deliberate.
    </p>

<!-- PRACTICE -->
<section class="section-light section-tight">
  <div class="container" style="max-width: 780px;">

    <h2>From regulation to organisational practice</h2>

    <p>
      Implementing the EU AI Act
      requires more than legal interpretation.
      It requires alignment with existing
      governance structures, risk management
      and accountability mechanisms.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>integration with internal control frameworks</li>
      <li>alignment with transparency obligations</li>
      <li>preparation for external supervision</li>
    </ul>
