    <h1>Use Cases: AI Governance in the Public Sector</h1>

    <p style="max-width: 720px;">
      Dutch Governance Advisory supports public organisations in the responsible, explainable
      and legally sound implementation of AI. Below are three generic examples of how we help
      governments and regulators apply the EU AI Act in practice.
    </p>

    <div class="services-grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Municipality – AI risk classification and governance design</h3>
        <p>
          A mid-sized municipality explored using AI for fraud detection. We assessed risk under the EU AI Act,
          provided governance recommendations, and designed oversight structures. The result: a high-risk classification
          and a clear roadmap for legal and organisational compliance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Public agency – algorithm register and transparency</h3>
        <p>
          Facing political and media pressure, a national agency sought to publish its algorithmic systems.
          We supported the development of a legally sound register and public explanations, aligned with transparency standards.
          Outcome: trust from both citizens and oversight bodies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Regulatory body – preparing for EU AI Act enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          A regulatory authority anticipated new enforcement powers under the EU AI Act.
          We analysed its mandate, drafted an internal reference framework, and helped build internal knowledge
          on algorithmic risks and governance scenarios.
