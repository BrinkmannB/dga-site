    <h2>Independent, public-interest driven AI governance</h2>

    <p>
      I support governments and public institutions in navigating the practical
      and legal implications of AI use. My work focuses on translating regulatory
      requirements — including the EU AI Act — into workable governance structures,
      transparency mechanisms and oversight arrangements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The emphasis is not on technology itself, but on responsibility:
      who decides, who oversees, and how public values are safeguarded
      when AI systems are deployed.
