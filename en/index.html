    <h2>What does the EU AI Act mean for public authorities?</h2>

    <p>
      The EU AI Act is European legislation that regulates the development,
      deployment and oversight of AI systems.
      For public authorities and supervisory bodies,
      the regulation directly affects accountability,
      transparency and public legitimacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI is increasingly used in public service delivery,
      supervision and decision-making.
      The AI Act requires public organisations to clearly explain
      how AI systems are used, which risks are involved
      and who is responsible at a governance level.

    <h2>AI governance requires clear institutional choices</h2>

    <p>
      Compliance with the EU AI Act is not merely a legal or technical exercise.
      It requires governance decisions:
      who authorises AI use, who oversees AI systems,
      and how accountability towards citizens is organised.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without clear AI governance,
      organisations risk fragmented compliance,
      reactive oversight and insufficient public trust.
