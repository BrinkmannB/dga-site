    <h1>AI Governance Services for the Public Sector</h1>

    <p style="max-width: 740px;">
      We help public organisations translate the EU AI Act and other regulatory frameworks into workable practices.
      Our focus is on legal clarity, governance integrity and public accountability — tailored to the political and institutional reality of government.

        <h3>EU AI Act Compliance & Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          We support governments and agencies in understanding their obligations under the EU AI Act,
          including risk classification, policy translation, and audit readiness.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Governance Structures & Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>
          We design roles, responsibilities and decision-making structures for AI systems
          in public administration — aligned with legal and ethical mandates.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Algorithm Registers & Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          From register architecture to public-facing language, we help you comply with transparency requirements
          and communicate algorithm use clearly to citizens and oversight bodies.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>AI Risk Scans & Maturity Checks</h3>
        <p>
          Quick diagnostic tools and deeper impact scans to assess where your organisation stands —
          and what steps are needed to strengthen AI governance.
