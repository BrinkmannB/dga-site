    <h2>What this outcome does indicate</h2>

    <p>
      This QuickScan highlights how AI governance currently functions
      within your organisation based on your responses.
      It points out where governance appears deliberate
      and where potential vulnerabilities or ambiguities may exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outcome is intended as a professional orientation point —
      a way to surface governance questions, not to resolve them.
    </p>

    <h2>What this outcome does not indicate</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>✕ No legal judgment or binding qualification</li>
      <li>✕ No formal AI Act risk classification</li>
      <li>✕ No compliance audit or assessment</li>
      <li>✕ No substitute for legal or technical analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance reflection</h2>

    <p>
      If this QuickScan raises questions, that is not a weakness
      but the core purpose of the instrument.
      AI governance requires explicit choices,
      clear accountability and insight into actual practice —
      not merely policies on paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The relevant follow-up question is therefore not:
      <em>“Is this right or wrong?”</em>,
      but:
      <em>“Is this governable, explainable and sustainable?”</em>
    </p>

    <div class="contact-disclaimer" style="margin-top:2rem;">
      <strong>Important:</strong>
      No rights can be derived from this outcome.
      The QuickScan is indicative and intended
      as a tool for governance reflection.
