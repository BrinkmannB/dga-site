    <h2>How I support public organisations</h2>

    <p>
      AI governance is not primarily a technical challenge.
      It is a question of responsibility, oversight and institutional design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I support ministries, municipalities, regulators and other public-sector bodies
      in translating regulatory requirements — including the EU AI Act —
      into workable governance structures and decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Core services</h2>

    <h3>AI Act Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      Guidance on classification, documentation, risk management and compliance
      obligations under the EU AI Act, with a focus on high-risk AI systems.
    </p>
    <p class="focus">
      <strong>Focus:</strong> legal interpretation, governance design and practical implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithm Registers & Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      Support in designing, improving and maintaining algorithm registers and
      transparency profiles in line with European and national requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="focus">
      <strong>Focus:</strong> explainability, accountability and public trust.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Governance Frameworks</h3>
    <p>
      Development of governance frameworks defining roles, responsibilities,
      escalation paths and oversight mechanisms for AI use within public organisations.
    </p>
    <p class="focus">
      <strong>Focus:</strong> decision-making authority and institutional responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Working approach</h2>

    <p>
      My approach is independent, careful and rooted in public-sector realities.
      No buzzwords, no technical overreach — but clear analysis, realistic choices
      and governance that works in practice.
