  <p>
    I work with governments, public institutions and non-profit organisations to help them apply AI in a
    responsible and human-centric way. My focus is on the intersection of governance, legal compliance,
    organisational design and public values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my work, I combine AI governance frameworks with practical, accessible guidance for decision-makers.
    Whether it is risk classification under the EU AI Act, transparency obligations or human-AI collaboration,
    my approach is rooted in clarity, context and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I regularly write and speak about the broader societal impact of AI, including democratic accountability,
    public-value alignment and the organisational dynamics of AI adoption.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mission: helping organisations design AI in a way that strengthens human judgement, protects
    fundamental rights and supports the public interest.
