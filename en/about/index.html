    <h2>Who I work with</h2>

    <p>
      I work with governments, public institutions and organisations
      operating in the public interest that are navigating the
      implications of AI use.
    </p>

    <p>
      These organisations often face complex questions:
      how to comply with the EU AI Act,
      how to organise oversight,
      and how to ensure that public values remain central
      when AI systems are introduced.
    </p>

    <h2>How I approach AI governance</h2>

    <p>
      My work starts from the premise that AI governance
      is not primarily a technical challenge.
      It is a matter of responsibility, institutional design
      and decision-making authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than focusing on tools or models,
      I focus on questions such as:
      who decides,
      who oversees,
      how risks are assessed,
      and how accountability is organised in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Independent and public-interest driven</h2>

    <p>
      I operate independently.
      I do not sell software, platforms or technical solutions,
      and I am not affiliated with vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows my advisory work to remain focused on
      what is appropriate, proportionate and defensible
      within a public-sector context.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      My background combines governance, policy analysis
      and advisory work in the field of AI and digitalisation.
      I regularly engage with developments around the EU AI Act,
      algorithmic transparency and public-sector oversight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The emphasis is on translating regulatory and ethical
      principles into workable governance arrangements
      that make sense for public organisations.
